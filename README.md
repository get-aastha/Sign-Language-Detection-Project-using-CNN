# Sign Language Detection Project

This project is about building a deep learning model for sign language detection. The model is trained on a dataset of images representing different sign language gestures.

# Software Specifictaions

1. Python: The code is written in Python. You will need a Python environment to run the code. You can use an environment like Anaconda or simply install Python on your machine.
2. Keras: This is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
3. TensorFlow: This is an open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
4. NumPy: This is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
5. OS: This is a module in Python that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules.
6. TensorBoard: This is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow. It enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph, projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space, and much more.

# Instructions

1. Make sure to unzip all the zipped files. I've done that to compress and store space.
2. Import Necessary Libraries: Import the necessary Keras and other libraries.
3. Run the ASL_detction.ipynb file on Google Colab to generate **signlanguagedetectionmodel48x48.json** and **signlanguagedetectionmodel48x48.h5** files. Sace them in the same repository where your project has been stored.
4. Open and run the files: collectdata.py, realtimedetection.py and split.py on VSCode or your preferred Py environment.
